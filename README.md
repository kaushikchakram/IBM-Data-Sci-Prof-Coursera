This repository consists of the materials and my project submissions for the `IBM Data Science Professional (v3) Certificate course on Coursera`.

**Context: This coursera course called `IBM Data Science Professional (v3) Certificate` consists of 12 courses. Upon successful completion of all the 12 courses one recieves the certificate.**

## The courses were successfully completed and the certificate can be found on **Credly (by Pearson)** on this **&rarr;** **[link](https://www.credly.com/badges/43179e45-2ec0-4418-a0af-697fbfb58ee9)** for verification purposes.

### The course material order is as follows:

**Note: Course 1 (What is Data Science?) and Course 12 (Career guide...) did not consist of any big lab materials so they are not included in this repository.**
<b>
>1. What is Data Science?
>2. Tools for Data Science?
>3. Data Science Methodology?
>4. Python for Data Science, AI & Development
>5. Python Project for Data Science
>6. Databases and SQL for Data Science with python
>7. Data Analysis with Python
>8. Data Visualization with Python
>9. Machine learning with Python
>10. Applied Data Science Capstone
>11. Generative AI: Elevate Your Data Science Career
>12. Data Scientist: Career Guide and Interview Preparation
</b>

**The course number and the folders are numbered correspondingly, so you can use that to navigate to the specific course folders.**

The courses overall, provide a framework for the leaner to get accustomed to the concepts and workflows of a Data Scientist. Once accustomed to these concepts, the learner can then apply these skills to a Research/Business Question. Courses 1-9 essentially introduces the learner to these concepts, eventually culminating to **Course 10** `Applied Data Science Capstone` wherein all the skills are tested on a project about SpaceX.
